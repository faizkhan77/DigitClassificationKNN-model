# Digit Classification using KNN Classifier

Welcome to the Digit Classification project repository! In this machine learning project, the digits dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is utilized to classify digits (0 to 9) using the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) classifier. Different values for k neighbors are explored to determine the value of K that gives the maximum score. The project involves plotting the confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation.

## Project Overview

### Dataset

- **Digits Dataset:**
  - The dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
  - Loaded using `load_digits` from `sklearn.datasets`.

### Model Training

- **KNN Classifier:**
  - The KNN classifier is trained on the digit dataset.
  - Different values for k neighbors are explored to find the optimal value.

- **GridSearchCV:**
  - GridSearchCV is employed to automate the process of finding the optimal value of K.

### Model Evaluation

- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the performance of the KNN classifier.
  - Confusion matrix provides insights into the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

- **Classification Report:**
  - A classification report is generated, providing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
  - Classification report offers a detailed summary of model performance.

## Project Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-classification-knn.git
   cd digit-classification-knn
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Execute the Jupyter Notebook (`digit_classification_knn.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

3. **Follow Notebook Instructions:**
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, train the KNN classifier, explore different values of k, and evaluate model performance.

4. **Plot Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:**
   - Visualize the model's performance using the confusion matrix and classification report.

## Note

This Digit Classification project demonstrates the application of the KNN classifier on the digits dataset. The optimal value of K is determined by exploring different values or using GridSearchCV. The confusion matrix and classification report provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

Feel free to explore, modify, and utilize this project for digit classification tasks. If you have any questions or suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.
